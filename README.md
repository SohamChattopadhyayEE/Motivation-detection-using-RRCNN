# RRCNN
This code refers to the paper entitled "Motivation detection using EEG signal analysis by residual-in-residual convolutional neural network", where the motivation level of different test subjects is detected by analyzing Electroencephalography Signals. Specifically, the proposed RRCNN model eventually detects whether a person is enough motivated to play a reward-based game (designed in the NTU lab) or not. It is to be noted that, here in the codeocean platform, the test data, test labels (both in .pkl format), and the pre-trained weights (in .pth format) are given.  Once the reproducible run is performed, the accuracy of the test data is obtained. By performing several test runs, the most occurring accuracy obtained on the test dataset is 89%.
